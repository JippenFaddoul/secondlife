0-lag poseball
===============

This is a poseball I made years ago, based off an existing handed-around script,
that didn't open a listener or do a lot of other useless, laggy things. Instead,
it just sits there, and appears and disappears when sat on.

Also, if you click it, it will hide or appear.

Usage
-----
Drop it in a prim with an animation. Adjust the title and offset if needed to 
line things up right. You're done.
